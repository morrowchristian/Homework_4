# Assignment: Populating Database with Mock Data

## Introduction
This assignment involves populating the database created in HW3 with mock data. It requires using PHP to generate the data and a data.sql file to update the tables. This README provides an overview of the assignment requirements, instructions, and deliverables.

## Assignment Overview
- **Part 1: Create Data for Tables**
  - Generate mock data for the following tables:
    - customer
    - order
    - product
    - order_item
    - address
    - warehouse
    - product_warehouse
  - Follow the specified order of insertion for data integrity.
- **Part 2: Create a PDF Report**
  - Briefly describe the process of generating data.
  - Highlight any innovative approaches or solutions used.
  - Discuss any challenges faced and how they were overcome.
  - Reflect on whether any aspects would be done differently.
- **Part 3: Deliverables**
  - schema.sql
  - data.sql
  - PHP files for data generation
  - Input files used (if any)
  - 1-page PDF report
  - Short YouTube video demonstrating completeness and correctness.

## Steps to Run
1. Execute schema.sql to create the database structure.
2. Run data.sql to populate the tables with generated data.
3. Test the populated database for completeness and correctness.

## Folder Structure
- **/data_generation**: Contains PHP scripts for generating mock data.
- **/input_files**: Holds any input files used for data generation.
- **/reports**: Stores the PDF report.
- **/videos**: Contains the YouTube presentation video.

## Usage
- Modify PHP scripts for customization or additional features.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed before executing PHP scripts.
- Review the PDF report for insights into the data generation process.

## Additional Notes
- Verify the correctness of the populated database before submission.
- Seek assistance if facing difficulties in running or understanding the code.
