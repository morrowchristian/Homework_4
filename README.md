# Database Population Assignment

In this assignment, you will populate your database from **Homework 3** with data. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Table Verification**: First, ensure that your tables are correctly structured. If there are any issues with the table structure, correct them before proceeding.

2. **Generating Mock Data**: You'll create mock data for your tables. Remember that in **HW3**, you created the schema (a set of tables) for the database, but they were empty. Now it's time to fill them with meaningful data.

3. **Using Techniques from HW3**: Utilize the techniques you learned in **HW3** to complete this assignment. Specifically, you'll use **PHP** to generate your data and create a `data.sql` file.

4. **Data Generation Approach**: Think of this data generation process as a **Mad Libs** exercise. You'll follow a template similar to the one below for product descriptions:

    ```
    A [adjective] [noun] in an [adjective] [color] made of [noun (material)] useful for [verb].
    ```

    For example:
    ```
    A wonderful hammer in an illustrious blue made of plastic useful for digging.
    ```

    Feel free to adapt this template for other aspects of your data.

5. **Random Full Names and Addresses**: Apply the same concept to generate random full names (combining random first names and last names) and addresses. Randomly assign street numbers, street names, types, cities, and states to create diverse addresses.

6. **Submission Requirements**:
    - Include any source code you used to generate your data.
    - Submit your `schema.sql` file along with your `data.sql` file.
    - Ensure that I can run your `schema.sql` file followed by your `data.sql` file to have a complete database populated with data. Test this before submitting!
    - Remember to rename your original database so you can preserve it.
